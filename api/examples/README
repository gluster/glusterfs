This is an example application which uses libgfapi. It is
a complete autotools based build system which demonstrates the
required changes in configure.ac, Makefile.am etc to successfully
detect for and build an application against libgfapi.

There are two approaches to building a libgfapi based application:

1. In the presence of pkg-config in your build system.
This is the recommended approach which is also used in this example.
For this approach to work, you need to build glusterfs by passing
--pkgconfigdir=/usr/lib64/pkgconfig (or the appropriate directory)
in your distro. This already happens if you build RPMs with the
glusterfs.spec provided in glusterfs.git. You will also need to
install glusterfs-api RPM.

2. In the absence of pkg-config in your build system.
Make sure your LDFLAGS includes -L/path/to/lib where libgfapi.so is
installed and -I/path/to/include/glusterfs where the 'api' directory
containing the headers are available.

glfsxmp.c
=========

glfsxmp.c is an example application which uses libgfapi

Compilation Steps For glfsxmp.c
===============================

1. $./autogen.sh
2. $./configure

Note: Before running ./configure , as mentioned above, you need to
      take care of #1 or #2 i.e. pkg-config path or LDFLAGS and
      -I/<path> with correct values.

3. $make glfsxmp
