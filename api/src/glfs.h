/* The filesystem object. One object per 'virtual mount' */

/*
  SYNOPSIS

  glfs_new: Create a new 'virtual mount' object.

  DESCRIPTION

  This is most likely the very first function you will use. This function
  will create a new glfs_t (virtual mount) object in memory.

  On this newly created glfs_t, you need to be either set a volfile path
  (glfs_set_volfile) or a volfile server (glfs_set_volfile_server).

  The glfs_t object needs to be initialized with glfs_init() before you
  can start issuing file operations on it.

  PARAMETERS

  @volname: Name of the volume. This identifies the server-side volume and
            the fetched volfile (equivalent of --volfile-id command line
	    parameter to glusterfsd). When used with glfs_set_volfile() the
	    @volname has no effect (except for appearing in log messages).

  RETURN VALUES

  NULL   : Out of memory condition.
  Others : Pointer to the newly created glfs_t virtual mount object.

*/

/*
  SYNOPSIS

  glfs_set_volfile: Specify the path to the volume specification file.

  DESCRIPTION

  If you are using a static volume specification file (without dynamic
  volume management abilities from the CLI), then specify the path to
  the volume specification file.

  This is incompatible with glfs_set_volfile_server().

  PARAMETERS

  @fs: The 'virtual mount' object to be configured with the volume
       specification file.

  @volfile: Path to the locally available volume specification file.

  RETURN VALUES

   0 : Success.
  -1 : Failure. @errno will be set with the type of failure.

*/

int glfs_set_volfile (glfs_t *fs, const char *volfile);


/*
  SYNOPSIS

  glfs_set_volfile_server: Specify the list of addresses for management server.

  DESCRIPTION

  This function specifies the list of addresses for the management server
  (glusterd) to connect, and establish the volume configuration. The @volname
  parameter passed to glfs_new() is the volume which will be virtually
  mounted as the glfs_t object. All operations performed by the CLI at
  the management server will automatically be reflected in the 'virtual
  mount' object as it maintains a connection to glusterd and polls on
  configuration change notifications.

  This is incompatible with glfs_set_volfile().

  PARAMETERS

  @fs: The 'virtual mount' object to be configured with the volume
       specification file.

  @transport: String specifying the transport used to connect to the
              management daemon. Specifying NULL will result in the usage
              of the default (tcp) transport type. Permitted values
              are those what you specify as transport-type in a volume
              specification file (e.g "tcp", "rdma" etc.)

  @host:      String specifying the address where to find the management daemon.
              This would either be
              - FQDN (e.g: "storage01.company.com") or
              - ASCII (e.g: "192.168.22.1")

  NOTE: This API is special, multiple calls to this function with different
        volfile servers, port or transport-type would create a list of volfile
        servers which would be polled during `volfile_fetch_attempts()`

  @port: The TCP port number where gluster management daemon is listening.
         Specifying 0 uses the default port number GF_DEFAULT_BASE_PORT.
         This parameter is unused if you are using a UNIX domain socket.

  RETURN VALUES

   0 : Success.
  -1 : Failure. @errno will be set with the type of failure.

  SYNOPSIS

  glfs_set_logging: Specify logging parameters.

  DESCRIPTION

  This function specifies logging parameters for the virtual mount.
  Default log file is /dev/null.

  PARAMETERS

  @fs: The 'virtual mount' object to be configured with the logging parameters.

  @logfile: The logfile to be used for logging. Will be created if it does not
            already exist (provided system permissions allow). If NULL, a new
            logfile will be created in default log directory associated with
            the glusterfs installation.

  @loglevel: Numerical value specifying the degree of verbosity. Higher the
             value, more verbose the logging.

  RETURN VALUES

   0 : Success.
  -1 : Failure. @errno will be set with the type of failure.

  SYNOPSIS

  glfs_init: Initialize the 'virtual mount'

  DESCRIPTION

  This function initializes the glfs_t object. This consists of many steps:
  - Spawn a poll-loop thread.
  - Establish connection to management daemon and receive volume specification.
  - Construct translator graph and initialize graph.
  - Wait for initialization (connecting to all bricks) to complete.

  PARAMETERS

  @fs: The 'virtual mount' object to be initialized.

  SYNOPSIS

  glfs_fini: Cleanup and destroy the 'virtual mount'

  DESCRIPTION

  This function attempts to gracefully destroy glfs_t object. An attempt is
  made to wait for all background processing to complete before returning.

  glfs_fini() must be called after all operations on glfs_t is finished.

  IMPORTANT

  IT IS NECESSARY TO CALL glfs_fini() ON ALL THE INITIALIZED glfs_t
  OBJECTS BEFORE TERMINATING THE PROGRAM. THERE MAY BE CACHED AND
  UNWRITTEN / INCOMPLETE OPERATIONS STILL IN PROGRESS EVEN THOUGH THE
  API CALLS HAVE RETURNED. glfs_fini() WILL WAIT FOR BACKGROUND OPERATIONS
  TO COMPLETE BEFORE RETURNING, THEREBY MAKING IT SAFE FOR THE PROGRAM TO
  EXIT.

  PARAMETERS

  @fs: The 'virtual mount' object to be destroyed.

  RETURN VALUES

   0 : Success.

  SYNOPSIS

      glfs_getvol: Get the volfile associated with a 'virtual mount'

  DESCRIPTION

      Sometimes it's useful e.g. for scripts to see the volfile, so that they
      can parse it and find subvolumes to do things like split-brain resolution
      or custom layouts.  The API here was specifically intended to make access
      e.g. from Python as simple as possible.

      Note that the volume must be started (not necessarily mounted) for this
      to work.

  PARAMETERS

      @fs:  The 'virtual mount' object for which a volfile is desired
      @buf: Pointer to a place for the volfile length to be stored
      @len: Length of @buf

  RETURN VALUES

       0: no volfile available
      <0: volfile length exceeds @len by N bytes (@buf unchanged)

  SYNOPSIS

       glfs_get_volumeid: Copy the Volume UUID stored in the glfs object fs.

  DESCRIPTION

       This function when invoked for the first time sends RPC call to the
       the management server (glusterd) to fetch volume uuid and stores it
       in the glusterfs_context linked to the glfs object fs which can be used
       in the subsequent calls. Later it parses that UUID to convert it from
       cannonical string format into an opaque byte array and copy it into
       the volid array. Incase if either of the input parameters, volid or size,
       is NULL, number of bytes required to copy the volume UUID is returned.

  PARAMETERS

       @fs: The 'virtual mount' object to be used to retrieve and store
            volume's UUID.
       @volid: Pointer to a place for the volume UUID to be stored

 * NOTES:

 *  - setgroups is a per thread setting, hence this is named as fsgroups to be

 *    caller
 *  - The groups once set, need to be unset by setting the size to 0 (in which
 *    case the list argument is a do not care)
 *  - Once a process for a thread of operation choses to set the IDs, all glfs
 *    calls made from that thread would default to the IDs set for the thread.
 *    As a result use these APIs with care and ensure that the set IDs are
 *    reverted to global process defaults as required.
