#    options:
#    -g  Terminate in graceful mode
#    -h  Show this message, then exit

# eg:

#  2. ./extras/stop-all-gluster-processes.sh -g
#
# By default, this script executes in force mode, i.e. all of brick, gsyncd
# and other glustershd services/processes are killed without checking for
# ongoing tasks such as geo-rep, self-heal, rebalance and etc. which may lead
# to inconsistency after the node is brought back.
#
# On specifying '-g' option this script works in graceful mode, to maintain
# data consistency the script fails with a valid exit code incase if any of
# the gluster processes are busy in doing their jobs.
#
# The author of page [1] proposes user-defined exit codes to the range 64 - 113

# The exit code returned by stop-all-gluster-processes.sh:
#   0       No errors/Success
