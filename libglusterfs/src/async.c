/* To implement an efficient thread pool with minimum contention we have used
 * the following ideas:
 *
 *    - The queue of jobs has been implemented using a Wait-Free queue provided
 *      by the userspace-rcu library. This queue requires a mutex when multiple
 *      consumers can be extracting items from it concurrently, but the locked
 *      region is very small, which minimizes the chances of contention. To
 *      further minimize contention, the number of active worker threads that
 *      are accessing the queue is dynamically adjusted so that we always have
 *      the minimum required amount of workers contending for the queue. Adding
 *      new items can be done with a single atomic operation, without locks.
 *
 *    - All queue management operations, like creating more threads, enabling
 *      sleeping ones, etc. are done by a single thread. This makes it possible
 *      to manage all scaling related information and workers lists without
 *      locks. This functionality is implemented as a role that can be assigned
 *      to any of the worker threads, which avoids that some lengthy operations
 *      could interfere with this task.
 *
 *    - Management is based on signals. We used signals for management tasks to
 *      avoid multiple system calls for each request (with signals we can wait
 *      for multiple events and get some additional data for each request in a
 *      single call, instead of first polling and then reading).
 *
 * TODO: There are some other changes that can take advantage of this new
 *       thread pool.
 *
 *          - Use this thread pool as the core threading model for synctasks. I
 *            think this would improve synctask performance because I think we
 *            currently have some contention there for some workloads.
 *
 *          - Implement a per thread timer that will allow adding and removing
 *            timers without using mutexes.
 *
 *          - Integrate with userspace-rcu library in QSBR mode, allowing
 *            other portions of code to be implemented using RCU-based
 *            structures with a extremely fast read side without contention.
 *
 *          - Integrate I/O into the thread pool so that the thread pool is
 *            able to efficiently manage all loads and scale dynamically. This
 *            could make it possible to minimize context switching when serving
 *            requests from fuse or network.
 *
 *          - Dynamically scale the number of workers based on system load.
 *            This will make it possible to reduce contention when system is
 *            heavily loaded, improving performance under these circumstances
 *            (or minimizing performance loss). This will also make it possible
 *            that gluster can coexist with other processes that also consume
 *            CPU, with minimal interference from each other.
