# This test tries to detect a race condition in write-behind. It's based on a
# reproducer written by Stefan Ring that is able to hit it sometimes. On my
# system, it happened around 10% of the runs. This means that if this bug
# appears again, this test will fail once every 10 runs. Most probably this
# failure will be hidden by the automatic test retry of the testing framework.
#
# Please, if this test fails, it needs to be analyzed in detail.
