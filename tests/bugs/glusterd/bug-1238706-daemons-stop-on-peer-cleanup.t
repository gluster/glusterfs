## To Do: Add test case for quota and snapshot daemon. Currently quota
##        Daemon is not working in cluster framework. And sanpd daemon
##        Start only in one node in cluster framework. Add test case
##        once patch http://review.gluster.org/#/c/11666/ merged,

## We are having 2 node "nfs" daemon should run on both node.

## Detach 2nd node from the cluster.

## After detaching 2nd node we will have only 1 nfs and quota daemon running.
