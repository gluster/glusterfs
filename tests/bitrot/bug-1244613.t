# The test makes use of inode-lru-limit to hit a scenario, where we
# find an inode whose ancestry is not there. Following is the
# hypothesis (which is confirmed by seeing logs indicating that
# codepath has been executed, but not through a good understanding of
# NFS internals).

#     At the end of an fop, the reference count of an inode would be
#     zero. The inode (and its ancestry) persists in memory only
#     because of non-zero lookup count. These looked up inodes are put
#     in an lru queue of size 1 (here). So, there can be at most one
#     such inode in memory.

#     NFS Server makes use of anonymous fds. So, if it cannot find
#     valid fd, it does a nameless lookup. This gives us an inode
#     whose ancestry is NULL. When a write happens on this inode,
#     quota-enforcer/marker finds a NULL ancestry and asks
#     storage/posix to build it.
