This document is intended to briefly explain how the Extended Attributes on 
Darwin 10.5.x releases works
----

On Darwin other than all the normal filesystem operations, 'Finder' (like 
Explorer in Windows but a little more) keeps its information in two extended 
attributes named 'com.apple.FinderInfo' and 'com.apple.ResourceFork'. If these 
xattrs are not implemented the filesystem won't be shown on Finder, and if they 
are not implemented properly there may be issues when some of the file operations 
are done through GUI of Finder. But when a filesystem is used over mountpoint in a 
terminal, everything is fine and these xattrs are not required. 

Currently the way these xattrs are implemented is simple. All the xattr calls 
(getxattr, setxattr, listxattr, removexattr) are passed down to underlaying filesystem,
most of the cases when exported FS is on MacOS X itself, these keys are supported, hence
the fops succeed. But in the case of using exports of different OS on Darwin the issue is 
extended attribute prefix like 'com.apple.' may not be supported, hence the problem with 
Finder. To solve this issue, GlusterFS returns virtual default values to these keys, which
works fine on most of the cases.
