This is a bugfix release. The release notes for [3.10.0](3.10.0.md),
contains a listing of all the new features that were added and
bugs in the GlusterFS 3.10 stable release.

## Major changes, features and limitations addressed in this release

1. auth-allow setting was broken with 3.10 release and is now fixed (#1429117) 

## Major issues

1. Expanding a gluster volume that is sharded may cause file corruption
    - Sharded volumes are typically used for VM images, if such volumes are
    expanded or possibly contracted (i.e add/remove bricks and rebalance)
    there are reports of VM images getting corrupted.
    - If you are using sharded volumes, DO NOT rebalance them till this is
    fixed
