### Known Issues:

- The following configuration changes are necessary for 'qemu' and 'samba vfs
  plugin' integration with libgfapi to work seamlessly:

   1. `gluster volume set <volname> server.allow-insecure on`
   2. restarting the volume is necessary

       ~~~
       gluster volume stop <volname>
       gluster volume start <volname>
       ~~~

   3. Edit `/etc/glusterfs/glusterd.vol` to contain this line:

       ~~~
       option rpc-auth-allow-insecure on
       ~~~

   4. restarting glusterd is necessary

       ~~~
       service glusterd restart
       ~~~

   More details are also documented in the Gluster Wiki on the [Libgfapi with qemu libvirt](http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Libgfapi_with_qemu_libvirt) page.

- For Block Device translator based volumes open-behind translator at the
  client side needs to be disabled.

  ~~~
  gluster volume set <volname> performance.open-behind disabled
  ~~~

- libgfapi clients calling `glfs_fini` before a successful `glfs_init` will cause the client to
  hang as reported [here](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gluster-devel/2014-04/msg00179.html).
  The workaround is NOT to call `glfs_fini` for error cases encountered before a successful
  `glfs_init`. This is being tracked in [Bug 1134050](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1134050) for
  glusterfs-3.5 and [Bug 1093594](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1093594) for mainline.

- If the `/var/run/gluster` directory does not exist enabling quota will likely
  fail ([Bug 1117888](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1117888)).
