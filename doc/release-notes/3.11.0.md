### gfapi extended readdirplus API has been added
*Notes for users:*

An extended readdirplus API `glfs_xreaddirplus` is added to get extra information along
 with readdirplus results on demand. This is useful for the applications (like NFS-Ganesha
 which needs handles) to retrieve more information along with stat in a single call, thus
 improving performance of work-loads involving directory listing.

The API syntax and usage can be found in
 [`glfs.h`](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/v3.11.0rc1/api/src/glfs.h#L810)
 header file.

*Limitations:*

This API currently has support to only return stat and handles (`glfs_object`) for each dirent
 of the directory, but can be extended in the future.

*Known Issues:*

None.
