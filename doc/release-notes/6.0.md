## Major changes and features

Features are categorized into the following sections,

- [Management](#management)
- [Standalone](#standalone)
- [Developer](#developer)

### Management

#### GlusterD2

TODO: Fill in GD2 status, as pertaining to GCS (container storage) release.

### Standalone

#### 1. Glusterfind tool enhanced with a filter option

glusterfind tool has an added option "--type", to be used with the "--full"
option. The option supports finding and listing files or directories only, and
defaults to both if not specified.

Example usage with the pre and query commands are given below,
1. Pre command ([reference](https://docs.gluster.org/en/latest/GlusterFS%20Tools/glusterfind/#pre-command)):
- Lists both files and directories in OUTFILE:
    `glusterfind pre SESSION_NAME VOLUME_NAME OUTFILE`

- Lists only files in OUTFILE:
    `glusterfind pre SESSION_NAME VOLUME_NAME OUTFILE --type f`

- Lists only directories in OUTFILE:
    `glusterfind pre SESSION_NAME VOLUME_NAME OUTFILE --type d`

2. Query command:
- Lists both files and directories in OUTFILE:
    `glusterfind query VOLUME_NAME --full OUTFILE`

- Lists only files in OUTFILE:
    `glusterfind query VOLUME_NAME --full --type f OUTFILE`

- Lists only directories in OUTFILE:
    `glusterfind query VOLUME_NAME --full --type d OUTFILE`

#### 2. FUSE mounts are enhanced to handle interrupts to blocked lock requests

FUSE mounts are enhanced to handle interrupts to blocked locks.

For example scripts using flock (`man 1 flock`) utility without the -n(nonblock)
option against files on a FUSE based gluster mount, can now be interrupted when
the lock is not granted in time or using the -w option from the same utility.

#### 3. client-side inode garbage collection via LRU list

A FUSE mounts inode cache can now be limited to a maximum number, thus reducing
the memory footprint of FUSE mount processes.

See lru-limit option in `man 8 mount.glusterfs` for usage details.

NOTE: Setting this to low numbers (say less than 4000), will evict inodes from
FUSE and Gluster caches at a much faster rate, and can cause performance
degrades. The setting has to be balanced across available client memory and
performance.

#### 4. Optimized/pass-through distribute functionality for 1-way distributed volumes

**NOTE:** There are no user controllable changes with this feature

Distribute xlator is optimized, to mostly pass-through operations, when the
distribute count is one for a volume, resulting in improved performance.

#### 5. Options introduced to disable invalidations of kernel page cache

For workloads, where multiple FUSE client mounts do not concurrently operate on
any files in the volume, it is now possible to maintain a longer duration kernel
page cache using the following options in conjunction,

- Setting `--auto-invalidation` option to "no" on the glusterfs FUSE mount
process
- Disabling the volume option `performance.global-cache-invalidation`

This enables better performance as the data is served from the kernel page cache
where possible.

### Developer

#### 1. Gluster code can be compiled and executed using [TSAN](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html)

While configuring the sources for a build use the extra option `--enable-tsan`
to enable thread sanitizer based builds.

#### 2. gfapi: A class of APIs have been enhances to return pre/post gluster_stat information

A set of [apis](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/release-6/api/src/gfapi.map#L245) have been enhanced to return pre/post gluster_stat information.
Applications using gfapi would need to adapt to the newer interfaces to compile
against release-6 apis. Pre-compiled applications, or applications using the
older API SDK will continue to work as before.
