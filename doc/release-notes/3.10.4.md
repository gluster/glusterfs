## Major changes, features and limitations addressed in this release
1. No Major changes


## Major issues
1. Expanding a gluster volume that is sharded may cause file corruption
- Sharded volumes are typically used for VM images, if such volumes are
expanded or possibly contracted (i.e add/remove bricks and rebalance)
there are reports of VM images getting corrupted.
- Status of this bug can be tracked here, [#1426508](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1426508)
2. Brick multiplexing is being tested and fixed aggressively but we still have a
   few crashes and memory leaks to fix.
3. Another rebalance related bug is being worked upon [#1467010](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1467010)
