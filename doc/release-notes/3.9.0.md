# Release notes for Gluster 3.9.0

This is a major release that includes a huge number of changes. Many
improvements contribute to better support of Gluster with containers and
running your storage on the same server as your hypervisors. Lots of work has
been done to integrate with other projects that are part of the Open Source
storage ecosystem.

The most notable features and changes are documented on this page. A full list
of bugs that has been addressed is included further below.

## Major changes and features

### Introducing reset-brick command
*Notes for users:*
The reset-brick command provides support to reformat/replace the disk(s)
represented by a brick within a volume. This is helpful when a disk goes bad etc

Start reset process -
```bash
gluster volume reset-brick VOLNAME HOSTNAME:BRICKPATH start
```
The above command kills the respective brick process. Now the brick can be reformatted.

To restart the brick after modifying configuration  -
```bash
gluster volume reset-brick VOLNAME HOSTNAME:BRICKPATH HOSTNAME:BRICKPATH commit
```
If the brick was killed to replace the brick with same brick path, restart with following command -
```bash
gluster volume reset-brick VOLNAME HOSTNAME:BRICKPATH HOSTNAME:BRICKPATH commit force
```

*Limitations:*
1. resetting a brick kills a brick process in concern. During this
period the brick will not be available for IO's.
2. Replacing a brick with this command will work only if both the brick paths
are same and belong to same volume.

### Get node level status of a cluster

*Notes for users:*
The get-state command provides node level status of a trusted storage pool from
the point of view of glusterd in a parseable format. Using get-state command,
external applications can invoke the command on all nodes of the cluster, and
parse and collate the data obtained from all these nodes to get a complete
picture of the state of the cluster.

```bash
# gluster get-state <glusterd> [odir <path/to/output/dir] [file <filename>]
```
This would dump data points that reflect the local state representation of the
cluster as maintained in glusterd (no other daemons are supported as of now)
to a file inside the specified output directory. The default output directory
and filename is /var/run/gluster and glusterd_state_<timestamp> respectively.

Following are the sections in the output:
1. `Global`: UUID and op-version of glusterd
2. `Global options`: Displays cluster specific options that have been set
explicitly through the volume set command.
3. `Peers`: Displays the peer node information including its hostname and
connection status
4. `Volumes`: Displays the list of volumes created on this node along with
detailed information on each volume.
5. `Services`: Displays the list of the services configured on this node along
with their corresponding statuses.

*Limitations:*
1. This only supports glusterd.
2. Does not provide complete cluster state. Data to be collated from all nodes
by external application to get the complete cluster state.

### Multi threaded self-heal for Disperse volumes
*Notes for users:*
Users now have the ability to configure multi-threaded self-heal in disperse volumes using the following commands:
```bash
Option below can be used to control number of parallel heals in SHD
# gluster volume set <volname> disperse.shd-max-threads [1-64] # default is 1
Option below can be used to control number of heals that can wait in SHD
# gluster volume set <volname> disperse.shd-wait-qlength [1-65536] # default is 1024
```

### Hardware extention acceleration in Disperse volumes
*Notes for users:*
If the user has hardware that has special instructions which can be used in erasure code calculations on the client it will be automatically used. At the moment this support is added for cpu-extentions: `x64`, `sse`, `avx`

### Lock revocation feature
*Notes for users:*
1. Motivation: Prevents cluster instability by mis-behaving clients causing bricks to OOM due to inode/entry lock pile-ups.
2. Adds option to strip clients of entry/inode locks after N seconds
3. Adds option to clear ALL locks should the revocation threshold get hit
4. Adds option to clear all or granted locks should the max-blocked threshold get hit (can be used in combination w/ revocation-clear-all).
5. Adds logging to indicate revocation event & reason
6. Options are:
```bash
# gluster volume set <volname> features.locks-revocation-secs <integer; 0 to disable>
# gluster volume set <volname> features.locks-revocation-clear-all [on/off]
# gluster volume set <volname> features.locks-revocation-max-blocked <integer>
```

### On demand scrubbing for Bitrot Detection:
*Notes for users:* With 'ondemand' scrub option, you don't need to wait for the scrub-frequency
to expire. As the option name itself says, the scrubber can be initiated on demand to detect
the corruption. If the scrubber is already running, this option is a no op.
```bash
# gluster volume bitrot <volume-name> scrub ondemand
```
 ### Improvements in Gluster NFS-Ganesha integration
*Notes for users:*
With this release the major change done is to store all the ganesha related configuration files in the shared storage volume mount point instead of having separate local copy in '/etc/ganesha' folder on each node.

For new users, before enabling nfs-ganesha

1. create a directory named *nfs-ganesha* in the shared storage mount point (*/var/run/gluster/shared_storage/*)

2. Create *ganesha.conf* & *ganesha-ha.conf* in that directory with the required details filled in.

For existing users, before starting nfs-ganesha service do the following :

1. Copy all the contents of */etc/ganesha* directory (including *.export_added* file) to */var/run/gluster/shared_storage/nfs-ganesha* from any of the ganesha nodes

2. Create symlink using */var/run/gluster/shared_storage/nfs-ganesha/ganesha.conf* on */etc/ganesha* one each node in ganesha-cluster

3. Change path for each export entry in *ganesha.conf* file

```sh
Example: if a volume "test" was exported, then ganesha.conf shall have below export entry -
 %include "/etc/ganesha/exports/export.test.conf" export entry.
Change that line to
 %include "/var/run/gluster/shared_storage/nfs-ganesha/exports/export.test.conf"
```

In addition, following changes have been made -
* The entity "HA_VOL_SERVER= " in *ganesha-ha.conf* is no longer required.
* A new resource-agent called portblock (available in >= *resource-agents-3.9.5* package) is added to the cluster configuration to speed up the nfs-client connections post IP failover or failback. This may be noticed while looking at the cluster configuration status using the command *pcs status*.

### Availability of python bindings to libgfapi

The official python bindings for GlusterFS libgfapi C library interface is
mostly API complete. The complete API reference and documentation can be
found at [libgfapi-python.rtfd.io](http://libgfapi-python.rtfd.io/)

The python bindings have been packaged and has been made available over
[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gfapi/).

### Small file improvements in Gluster with md-cache (Experimental)
*Notes for users:*
With this release, metadata cache on the client side is integrated with the
cache-invalidation feature so that the clients can cache longer without
compromising on consistency.  By enabling, the metadata cache and cache
invalidation feature and extending the cache timeout to 600s, we have seen
performance improvements in metadata operation like creates, ls/stat, chmod,
rename, delete.  The perf improvements is significant in SMB access of gluster
volume, but as a cascading effect the improvements is also seen on FUSE/Native
access and NFS access.

Use the below options in the order mentioned, to enable the features:
```bash
  # gluster volume set <volname> features.cache-invalidation on
  # gluster volume set <volname> features.cache-invalidation-timeout 600
  # gluster volume set <volname> performance.stat-prefetch on
  # gluster volume set <volname> performance.cache-invalidation on
  # gluster volume set <volname> performance.cache-samba-metadata on     # Only for SMB access
  # gluster volume set <volname> performance.md-cache-timeout 600
```

### Real time Cluster notifications using Events APIs
Let us imagine we have a Gluster monitoring system which displays
list of volumes and its state, to show the realtime status, monitoring
app need to query the Gluster in regular interval to check volume
status, new volumes etc. Assume if the polling interval is 5 seconds
then monitoring app has to run gluster volume info command ~17000
times a day!

With Gluster 3.9 release, Gluster provides close to realtime
notification and alerts for the Gluster cluster state changes and
alerts. Webhooks can be registered to listen to Events emitted by
Gluster. More details about this new feature is available here.

### Geo-replication improvements
#### Documentation improvements:

Upstream documentation is rewritten to reflect the latest version of
Geo-replication. Removed the stale/duplicate documentation. We are
still working on to add Troubleshooting, Cluster expand/shrink notes
to it. Latest version of documentation is available here
http://gluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Administrator%20Guide/Geo%20Replication

#### Geo-replication Events are available for Events API consumers:
Events APIs is the new Gluster feature available with 3.9 release,
most of the events from Geo-replication are added to eventsapi.

Read more about the Events APIs and Geo-replication events here
http://gluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Administrator%20Guide/Events%20APIs

#### New simplified command to setup Non root Geo-replication

Non root Geo-replication setup was not easy with multiple manual
steps. Non root Geo-replication steps are simplified. Read more about
the new steps in Admin guide.

http://gluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Administrator%20Guide/Geo%20Replication/#slave-user-setup

#### New command to generate SSH keys(Alternative command to `gsec_create`)

`gluster system:: execute gsec_create` command generates ssh keys in
every Master cluster nodes and copies to initiated node. This command
silently ignores error if any node is down in cluster. It will not
collect SSH keys from that node. When Geo-rep create push-pem command
is issued it will copy public keys from those nodes which were up
during gsec_create. This causes Geo-rep to go to Faulty when that
master node tries to make the connection to slave nodes. With the new
command, output shows if any Master node was down while generating ssh
keys. Read more about `gluster-georep-sshkey

http://gluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Administrator%20Guide/Geo%20Replication/#setting-up-the-environment-for-geo-replication

#### Logging improvements

New logs are added, now from the log we can clearly understand what is
going on. Note: This feature may change logging format of existing log
messages, Please update your parsers if used to parse Geo-rep logs.

Patch: http://review.gluster.org/15710

#### New Configuration options available: changelog-log-level

All the changelog related log messages are logged in
`/var/log/glusterfs/geo-replication/<SESSION>/*.changes.log` in Master
nodes. Log level was hard coded as `TRACE` for Changelog logs. New
configuration option provided to modify the changelog log level and
defaulted to `INFO`

## Behavior changes
- [#1221623](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1221623): Earlier the ports GlusterD
  used to allocate for the daemons like brick processes, quotad, shd et all
  were persistent through the volume's life cycle, so every restart of the
  process(es) or a node reboot will try to use the same ports which were
  allocated for the first time. With release-3.9 onwards, GlusterD will try to
  allocate a fresh port once a daemon is restarted or the node is rebooted.
- [#1348944](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1348944): with 3.9 release the default
  log file for glusterd has been renamed to glusterd.log from
  etc-glusterfs-glusterd.vol.log

## Known Issues
- [#1387878](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1387878):add-brick on a vm-store
  configuration which has sharding enabled is leading to vm corruption. To work
  around this issue, one can scale up by creating more volumes until this issue
  is fixed.
