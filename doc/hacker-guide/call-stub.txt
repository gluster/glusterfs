creating a call stub and pausing a call
---------------------------------------
libglusterfs provides seperate API to pause each of the fop. parameters to each API is
@frame - call frame which has to be used to resume the call at call_resume().
@fn    - procedure to call during call_resume(). 
       NOTE: @fn should exactly take the same type and number of parameters that 
             the corresponding regular fop takes.
rest will be the regular parameters to corresponding fop.

NOTE: @frame can never be NULL. fop_<operation>_stub() fails with errno
      set to EINVAL, if @frame is NULL. also wherever @loc is applicable,
      @loc cannot be NULL.

refer to individual stub creation API to know about call-stub creation's behaviour with
specific parameters.

here is the list of stub creation APIs for xlator fops.

resuming a call:
---------------
  call can be resumed using call stub through call_resume API.

  void call_resume (call_stub_t *stub);

  stub - call stub created during pausing a call.

  NOTE: call_resume() will decrease reference count of any fd_t, dict_t and inode_t that it finds
        in  stub->args.<operation>.<fd_t-or-inode_t-or-dict_t>. so, if any fd_t, dict_t or
	inode_t pointers are assigned at stub->args.<operation>.<fd_t-or-inode_t-or-dict_t> after
	fop_<operation>_stub() call, they must be <fd_t-or-inode_t-or-dict_t>_ref()ed.
	
	call_resume does not STACK_DESTROY() for any fop.
	
  if stub->fn is NULL, call_resume does STACK_WIND() or STACK_UNWIND() using the stub->frame.

  return - call resume fails only if stub is NULL. call resume fails with errno set to EINVAL.
