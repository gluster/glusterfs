  <title>Managing Unified File and Object Storage</title>
  <para>Unified File and Object Storage (UFO) unifies NAS and object storage technology. It
provides a system for data storage that enables users to access the same data,  both as an object and as a
file, thus simplifying management and controlling storage costs.

</para>
  <para>Unified File and Object Storage is built upon Openstack&apos;s Object Storage Swift. Open Stack Object Storage allows users to store and retrieve files and content through a simple Web Service (REST: Representational State Transfer) interface as objects and GlusterFS, allows  users to store and retrieve files using Native Fuse and NFS mounts. It uses GlusterFS as a backend file system for Open Stack Swift. It also leverages on  Open Stack Swift&apos;s web interface for storing and retrieving files over the web combined with GlusterFS features like scalability and high availability, replication, elastic volume management  for data management at disk level.</para>
  <para>Unified File and Object Storage technology enables enterprises to adopt and deploy
cloud storage solutions. It allows users to access and modify data as objects from a
REST interface along with the ability to access and modify files from NAS interfaces including NFS
and CIFS. In addition to decreasing cost and making it faster and easier to access object data,
it also delivers massive scalability, high availability and replication of object storage.
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers can utilize GlusterFS  Unified File and Object Storage technology to enable their own cloud
storage service. Enterprises can use this technology to accelerate the process of preparing file-based
applications for the cloud and simplify new application development for cloud computing
environments.

</para>
  <para>OpenStack Object Storage is scalable object storage system and it is not a traditional file system. You will not be able to mount this system like traditional SAN or NAS
volumes and perform POSIX compliant operations. </para>

    <title>Components of Object Storage</title>
    <para>The major components of Object Storage are:
 </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Proxy Server</emphasis>

</para>
    <para>All REST requests to the UFO are routed through the Proxy Server.


</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Objects and Containers </emphasis></para>
    <para>An object is the basic storage entity and any optional metadata that represents the data
you store. When you upload data, the data is stored as-is (with no compression or encryption).

</para>
    <para>A container is a storage compartment for your data and provides a way for you to organize
your data. Containers can be visualized as directories in a Linux system. Data must be stored in a container and hence objects are created within a container.

</para>
    <para>It implements objects as files and directories under the container. The object name is a &apos;/&apos; separated path and UFO maps it to directories until the last name in the path, which is marked as a file.  With this approach, objects can be accessed as files and directories from native GlusterFS (FUSE)  or NFS mounts by providing the &apos;/&apos; separated path.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Accounts and Account Servers</emphasis></para>
    <para>The OpenStack Object Storage system is designed to be used by many different storage
consumers. Each user is associated with one or more accounts and must identify themselves using an authentication system. While authenticating, users must provide the name of the account for which the authentication is requested.

</para>
    <para>UFO implements accounts as GlusterFS volumes. So, when a user is granted read/write permission on an account, it  means that that user has access to all the data available on that GlusterFS volume. 




</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Authentication and Access Permissions</emphasis>

</para>
    <para>You must authenticate against an authentication service to receive OpenStack Object
Storage connection parameters and an authentication token. The token must be passed
in for all subsequent container or object operations. One authentication service that you
can use as a middleware example is called <literal>tempauth</literal>.</para>
    <para>By default, each user has their own storage account and has full access to that
account. Users must authenticate with their credentials as described above, but once
authenticated they can manage containers and objects within that account. If a user wants to access  the content from another account, they must have API access key or a session token provided by their authentication system.</para>

      <title>Configuring Proxy Server</title>
      <para>The Proxy Server is responsible for connecting to the rest of the OpenStack Object Storage architecture. For each request, it looks up the location of the account, container, or object in the ring and route the request accordingly. The public API is also exposed through the proxy server.  When objects are streamed to or from an object server, they are streamed directly through the proxy server to or from the user – the proxy server does not spool them.
</para>
      <para>The configurable options pertaining to proxy server are stored in <filename>/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf</filename>.  The following is the sample  <filename>proxy-server.conf</filename> file:</para>
      <para><programlisting>[app:proxy-server]

      <title>Configuring Object Server</title>
      <para>The Object Server is a very simple blob storage server that can store, retrieve, and delete objects stored on local devices. Objects are stored as binary files on the file system with metadata stored in the file’s extended attributes (xattrs). This requires that the underlying file system choice for object servers support xattrs on files. 

</para>
      <para>The configurable options pertaining Object Server are stored in the file <filename>/etc/swift/object-server/1.conf</filename>.  The following is the sample  <filename>object-server/1.conf</filename> file:</para>

      <title>Configuring Authenticated Access </title>
      <para>Authentication is the process of proving identity to the system. To use the REST interface, you must
obtain an authorization token using GET method and supply it with v1.0 as the path.
</para>
      <para>Each REST request against the Object Storage system requires the addition of a specific authorization
token HTTP x-header, defined as X-Auth-Token. The storage URL and authentication token are
returned in the headers of the response.
</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>To authenticate, run the following command:
</para>
          <programlisting>GET auth/v1.0 HTTP/1.1
Host: &lt;auth URL&gt;
X-Auth-User: &lt;account name&gt;:&lt;user name&gt;
X-Auth-Key: &lt;user-Password&gt;</programlisting>
          <para>For example,
</para>
          <programlisting>GET auth/v1.0 HTTP/1.1
Host: auth.example.com
X-Auth-User: test:tester
X-Auth-Key: testing

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Content-Length: 0
Date: Wed, 10 jul 2011 06:11:51 GMT</programlisting>
          <para>To  authenticate access using cURL (for the above example), run the following
command:
</para>
          <programlisting>curl -v -H &apos;X-Storage-User: test:tester&apos; -H &apos;X-Storage-Pass:testing&apos; -k
https://auth.example.com:443/auth/v1.0</programlisting>
          <para>The X-Auth-Url has to be parsed and used in the connection and request line of all subsequent
requests to the server. In the example output, users connecting to server will send most
container/object requests with a host header of example.storage.com and the request line&apos;s version
and account as v1/AUTH_test.
