* Authentication is provided by two modules ip and login. Login based authentication uses username/password from client for authentication. Each module returns either ACCEPT, REJCET or DONT_CARE. DONT_CARE is returned if the input authentication information to the module is not concerned to its working. The theory behind authentication is that "none of the auth modules should return REJECT and atleast one of them should return ACCEPT"

* Currently all the authentication related information is passed un-encrypted over the network from client to server.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* options provided in protocol/client:
	* for username/password based authentication:
	      option username <username>
	      option password <password>
	* client can have only one set of username/password
	* for ip based authentication:
	      * no options required in protocol/client. Client has to bind to privileged port (port < 1024 ) which means the process in which protocol/client is loaded has to be run as root.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* options provided in protocol/server:
	* for username/password based authentication:
	      option auth.login.<brick>.allow [comma seperated list of usernames using which clients can connect to volume <brick>]
	      option auth.login.<username>.password <password> #specify password <password> for username <username>
	* for ip based authentication:
	      option auth.ip.<brick>.allow [comma seperated list of ip addresses from which clients are allowed to connect to volume <brick>]
	      option auth.ip.<brick>.reject [comma seperated list of ip addresses from which clients are not allowed to connect to volume <brick>]
	* negation operator '!' is used to invert the sense of matching.
	  Eg., option auth.ip.brick.allow !a.b.c.d #do not allow client from a.b.c.d to connect to volume brick
	       option auth.ip.brick.reject !w.x.y.z #allow client from w.x.y.z to connect to volume brick
	* wildcard '*' can be used to match any ips

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Usecases:

* username/password based authentication only
      protocol/client:
	option username foo
	option password foo-password
	option remote-subvolume foo-brick

      protocol/server:
	option auth.login.foo-brick.allow foo,who #,other users allowed to connect to foo-brick
	option auth.login.foo.password foo-password
	option auth.login.who.password who-password

      * in protocol/server, dont specify ip from which client is connecting in auth.ip.foo-brick.reject list

****************************************************************************************************

* ip based authentication only
      protocol/client:
	option remote-subvolume foo-brick
	* Client is connecting from a.b.c.d
      
      protocol/server:
	option auth.ip.foo-brick.allow a.b.c.d,e.f.g.h,i.j.k.l #, other ip addresses from which clients are allowed to connect to foo-brick

****************************************************************************************************
* ip and username/password based authentication
  * allow only "user foo from a.b.c.d"
    protocol/client:
	option username foo
	option password foo-password
	option remote-subvolume foo-brick

    protocol/server:
	option auth.login.foo-brick.allow foo
	option auth.login.foo.password foo-password
	option auth.ip.foo-brick.reject !a.b.c.d

  * allow only "user foo" from a.b.c.d i.e., only user foo is allowed from a.b.c.d, but anyone is allowed from ip addresses other than a.b.c.d
    protocol/client:
	option username foo
	option password foo-password
	option remote-subvolume foo-brick

    protocol/server:
	option auth.login.foo-brick.allow foo
	option auth.login.foo.password foo-password
	option auth.ip.foo-brick.allow !a.b.c.d

  * reject only "user shoo from a.b.c.d"
    protcol/client:
	option remote-subvolume shoo-brick
    
    protocol/server:
	# observe that no "option auth.login.shoo-brick.allow shoo" given
	# Also other users from a.b.c.d have to be explicitly allowed using auth.login.shoo-brick.allow ...
	option auth.ip.shoo-brick.allow !a.b.c.d

  * reject only "user shoo" from a.b.c.d i.e., user shoo from a.b.c.d has to be rejected. 
    * same as reject only "user shoo from a.b.c.d" above, but rules have to be added whether to allow ip addresses (and users from those ips) other than a.b.c.d

****************************************************************************************************

* ip or username/password based authentication
  
  * allow user foo or clients from a.b.c.d
    protocol/client:
	option remote-subvolume foo-brick

    protocol/server:
	option auth.login.foo-brick.allow foo
	option auth.login.foo.password foo-password
	option auth.ip.foo-brick.allow a.b.c.d

  * reject user shoo or clients from a.b.c.d
    protocol/client:
	option remote-subvolume shoo-brick
   
    protocol/server:
	option auth.login.shoo-brick.allow <usernames other than shoo>
	#for each username mentioned in the above <usernames other than shoo> list, specify password as below
	option auth.login.<username other than shoo>.password password
