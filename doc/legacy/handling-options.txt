How to add a new option to a given volume ?
===========================================

* Add a entry in 'struct volume_options options[]' with your key, what is
  the type of the 'key', etc.

* The 'key' and corresponding 'value' given for the same by user are validated
  before calling init() of the translator/transport/scheduler/auth-module.

* Once the complete init() is successful, user will get a warning if he has
  given a 'key' which is not defined in these modules.
